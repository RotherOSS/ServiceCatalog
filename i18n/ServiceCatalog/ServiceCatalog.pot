msgid "Within the ServiceCatalogue tile in the customer dashboard, it is possible to show ticket types for preconfigured ticket creation inside the service description. Furthermore, it is possible to restrict the services for other screens using the ticket types set here. If you wish to do this, please activate the options \"ServiceCatalog::CreateTypeServiceRelatedAcls\" and \"ServiceCatalog::CreateTypeServiceRelatedAcls::Options\" in the OTOBO system configuration. The restriction is made via automatically generated ACLs, which can be viewed under \"Admin -> Access Control Lists (ACL)\". If necessary, please adjust the option \"ServiceCatalog::CreateTypeServiceRelatedAcls::Options\" according to your requirements."

msgid "If we work service-based, we do not want to offer the customer a choice of queues in the customer portal when creating a ticket, but decide on the basis of the service into which queue (or which team of agents) the ticket should be processed first. In order to use this option sensibly, please deactivate the option \"Ticket::Frontend::CustomerTicketMessage###Queue\" and set a sensible default queue in the option \"Ticket::Frontend::CustomerTicketMessage###QueueDefault\". As soon as you set a \"Ticket destination queue\" here in the service, the ticket will immediately be created in this queue. If the field remains empty, the default queue configured above will be used."
