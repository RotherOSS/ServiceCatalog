Furthermore, it is possible to restrict the services for other screens using the ticket types set here. If you wish to do this, please activate the options \"ServiceCatalog::CreateTypeServiceRelatedAcls\" and \"ServiceCatalog::CreateTypeServiceRelatedAcls::Options\" in the OTOBO system configuration. The restriction is made via automatically generated ACLs, which can be viewed under \"Admin -> Access Control Lists (ACL)\".

As soon as you set a \"Ticket destination queue\" here in the service, the ticket will immediately be created in this queue.
